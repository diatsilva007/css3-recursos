# <div align="center"> Normalize CSS </div>

## Overview

Normalize.css is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements. It's a modern alternative to traditional CSS resets. Normalize.css preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets, which may override some of the useful default browser styles.

## Features

- **Cross-browser consistency:** Normalize.css ensures consistent styling across different browsers by providing a common baseline.
- **Preserves useful defaults:** Unlike CSS resets, Normalize.css preserves some default browser styling that is considered useful and improves upon it.
- **Easy to use:** Simply include Normalize.css in your project's stylesheet and it will automatically normalize the styles across different browsers.

## Installation

You can include Normalize.css in your project by either downloading the file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) or by installing it via npm:

```bash
npm install normalize.css
```

Then, include it in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/normalize.css">
```

## Usage

Include Normalize.css at the beginning of your project's stylesheet to ensure that it applies before any other styles. 

```css
/* Import Normalize.css */
@import 'normalize.css';
```

Or you can include it directly in your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="normalize.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your HTML content here -->
</body>
</html>
```
